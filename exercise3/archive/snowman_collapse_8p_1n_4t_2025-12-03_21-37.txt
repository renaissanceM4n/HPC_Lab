Summary: snowman_collapse is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:                                     88.3%    (22.3s) |========|
MPI:                                         11.8%     (3.0s) ||
I/O:                                          0.0%     (0.0s) |
This application run was Compute-bound (based on main thread activity). A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is in the CPU section below.
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 88.3% (22.3s) CPU time:
Single-core code:                             0.0%     (0.0s) |
OpenMP regions:                             100.0%    (22.3s) |=========|
Scalar numeric ops:                          56.2%    (12.6s) |=====|
Vector numeric ops:                           0.0%     (0.0s) |
Memory accesses:                             34.6%     (7.7s) |==|
The per-core performance is arithmetic-bound. Try to increase the amount of time spent in vectorized instructions by analyzing the compiler's vectorization reports.
Significant time is spent on memory accesses. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 11.8% (3.0s) MPI time:
Time in collective calls:                   100.0%     (3.0s) |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:                 0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process collective rate:             266 kB/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:        0.00 bytes/s

I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% (0.0s) I/O time:
Time in reads:                                0.0%     (0.0s) |
Time in writes:                               0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process read rate:                  0.00 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:                 0.00 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!

OpenMP:
A breakdown of the 100.0% (22.3s) time in OpenMP regions:
Computation:                                 99.1%    (22.1s) |=========|
Synchronization:                              0.9%     (0.2s) ||
Physical core utilization:                   33.3%            |==|
System load:                                 29.4%            |==|
Physical core utilization is low and some cores may be unused. Try increasing OMP_NUM_THREADS to improve performance.

Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:                     182 MiB
Peak process memory usage:                     188 MiB
Peak node memory usage:                       0.0%            |

Thread Affinity:
A breakdown of how software threads have been pinned to logical cores (1 per physical core).
Mean utilization:                            33.3%            |==|
Max load:                                     1.25

[INFORMATION] consider improving node utilization by running 96 threads per node (1 thread per core).
