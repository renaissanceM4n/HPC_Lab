Summary: snowman_no_collapse is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:                                     93.7%    (22.2s) |========|
MPI:                                          6.3%     (1.5s) ||
I/O:                                          0.0%     (0.0s) |
This application run was Compute-bound (based on main thread activity). A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is in the CPU section below.
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 93.7% (22.2s) CPU time:
Single-core code:                             0.0%     (0.0s) |
OpenMP regions:                             100.0%    (22.2s) |=========|
Scalar numeric ops:                          41.4%     (9.2s) |===|
Vector numeric ops:                           0.0%     (0.0s) |
Memory accesses:                             52.2%    (11.6s) |====|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 6.3% (1.5s) MPI time:
Time in collective calls:                   100.0%     (1.5s) |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:                 0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process collective rate:            1.11 MB/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:        0.00 bytes/s

I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% (0.0s) I/O time:
Time in reads:                                0.0%     (0.0s) |
Time in writes:                               0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process read rate:                  0.00 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:                 0.00 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!

OpenMP:
A breakdown of the 100.0% (22.2s) time in OpenMP regions:
Computation:                                 76.6%    (17.0s) |=======|
Synchronization:                             23.4%     (5.2s) |=|
Physical core utilization:                   66.7%            |======|
System load:                                 45.9%            |====|
OpenMP thread performance looks good. Check the CPU breakdown for advice on improving code efficiency.

Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:                     185 MiB
Peak process memory usage:                     192 MiB
Peak node memory usage:                       0.0%            |
