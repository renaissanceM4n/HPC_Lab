Summary: snowman_collapse is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:                                     87.5%    (44.1s) |========|
MPI:                                         12.5%     (6.3s) ||
I/O:                                          0.0%     (0.0s) |
This application run was Compute-bound (based on main thread activity). A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is in the CPU section below.
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 87.5% (44.1s) CPU time:
Single-core code:                            <0.1%     (0.0s) ||
OpenMP regions:                             100.0%    (44.1s) |=========|
Scalar numeric ops:                          56.2%    (24.8s) |=====|
Vector numeric ops:                           0.0%     (0.0s) |
Memory accesses:                             32.5%    (14.4s) |==|
The per-core performance is arithmetic-bound. Try to increase the amount of time spent in vectorized instructions by analyzing the compiler's vectorization reports.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 12.5% (6.3s) MPI time:
Time in collective calls:                   100.0%     (6.3s) |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:                 0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process collective rate:             117 kB/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:        0.00 bytes/s

I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% (0.0s) I/O time:
Time in reads:                                0.0%     (0.0s) |
Time in writes:                               0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process read rate:                  0.00 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:                 0.00 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!

OpenMP:
A breakdown of the 100.0% (44.1s) time in OpenMP regions:
Computation:                                 99.1%    (43.7s) |=========|
Synchronization:                              0.9%     (0.4s) ||
Physical core utilization:                   16.7%            |=|
System load:                                 15.4%            |=|
Physical core utilization is low and some cores may be unused. Try increasing OMP_NUM_THREADS to improve performance.

Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:                     181 MiB
Peak process memory usage:                     186 MiB
Peak node memory usage:                       0.0%            |
