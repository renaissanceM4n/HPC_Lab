Summary: snowman is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:                                     86.2%    (21.4s) |========|
MPI:                                         13.8%     (3.4s) ||
I/O:                                          0.0%     (0.0s) |
This application run was Compute-bound (based on main thread activity). A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is in the CPU section below.
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 86.2% (21.4s) CPU time:
Scalar numeric ops:                          54.5%    (11.6s) |====|
Vector numeric ops:                           0.0%     (0.0s) |
Memory accesses:                             31.6%     (6.7s) |==|
The per-core performance is arithmetic-bound. Try to increase the amount of time spent in vectorized instructions by analyzing the compiler's vectorization reports.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 13.8% (3.4s) MPI time:
Time in collective calls:                   100.0%     (3.4s) |=========|
Time in point-to-point calls:                 0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process collective rate:            56.8 kB/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:        0.00 bytes/s

I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% (0.0s) I/O time:
Time in reads:                                0.0%     (0.0s) |
Time in writes:                               0.0%     (0.0s) |
Effective process read rate:                  0.00 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:                 0.00 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!

Threads:
A breakdown of how multiple threads were used:
Computation:                                100.0%  (2479.4s) |=========|
Synchronization:                              0.0%     (0.0s) |
Physical core utilization:                   33.3%            |==|
System load:                                 33.5%            |==|
Physical core utilization is low. Try increasing the number of threads or processes to improve performance.

Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:                     183 MiB
Peak process memory usage:                     187 MiB
Peak node memory usage:                       1.0%            ||
The peak node memory usage is very low. Running with fewer MPI processes and more data on each process may be more efficient.

Energy:
A breakdown of how energy was used:
CPU:                                      not supported
System:                                   not supported
Mean node power:                          not supported
Peak node power:                              0.00 W

Thread Affinity:
A breakdown of how software threads have been pinned to logical cores (1 per physical core).
Mean utilization:                           100.0%            |=========|
Max load:                                     8.00 
Migration opportunity:                        12.0 
[ERROR] 32 processes have overlapping affinity masks e.g. ranks 1 and 9
[ERROR] detected compute threads with overlapping affinity masks
[INFORMATION] consider improving node utilization by running 8 processes per node (1 process per NUMANode).
